*************************
** Unit Testing Policy **
*************************

 Unit testing should be performed after every compilation to maintain the integrity of previous
work and to allow quick recognition of bugs and other potential problems. For C++ projects the
CppUnit framework should be used (http://cppunit.sourceforge.net/). A mirror of the source 
directory structure should be held in src/Test for unit test classes. For programs that can handle
command line arguments a '-mode unit_test' option must be made available which forces a run of
all available unit tests related to that project and then exits with a non-zero return value
if any fail, zero otherwise.

 When to Write Unit Tests
 ------------------------

 1. Complex or critical functions/classes should always be accompanied by appropriate unit tests.
 2. When bugs occur, a unit test should be written immediately to cover that case.
 3. For functions/classes not covered by 1, unit tests should be written as time allows.
