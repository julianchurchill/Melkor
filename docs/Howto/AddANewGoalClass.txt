How to add a new goal class
---------------------------

 1. Create a class extending GoalInterface. Implement the virtual functions.
 2. Add a new type to the GoalInterface::GoalType enum.
 3. Add an entry into Goal::addGoal() so that it creates the correct object type
    when adding to the meta goal. Include the new goal class header file in Goal.h.
 4. Add an entry into Goal::parseGoalString() to allow easy setup through GTP or
    in commented SGF files for automated testing.
